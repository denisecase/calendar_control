## Getting started (on Windows)

Before working through the Python quickstart guide, install Git for Windows.
During installation, check the "Git Bash Here" option.  
Then, from Windows Explorer, you can open a Git Bash window by right-clicking on a folder
and execute Linux commands in that location. 

Edit the semester start date on line 28.
Edit the number of weeks in the semester on line 29.

Open a command window as administrator in the calendar_control folder, and type:
> py calendar_control.py
